front_description: "The process of defining/designing a specific solution to the functional requirements allocated to the project in the Functional and Non-functional Requirements Specification baseline. The solution functional design consists of a set of “functional components” integrated into a software system (application) and the underlying data sources (databases or file systems) accessed by the functional components. The “functional component specification” describes the external behaviour (interactions with users and/or external systems) and internal activities (internal data access and/or manipulation activities), deferring component’s internal structure decisions to the CTR process. Each functional component belongs to a “functional component type” and must be compliant with the functional pattern defined for the “functional component type” in the ARC process."
