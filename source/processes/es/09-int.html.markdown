front_description: "The process of integrating functional components into a working system (system build), and testing the direct interactions (calls, invocations and message exchange) between the functional components. If interfaces with external systems exist, external interactions are tested. If development platform is different from production platform, portability and compatibility with the production platform is tested. If application functionality is exposed using web-browsers or web-services, penetration test should be executed. Component integration process includes the activities for detecting and fixing component integration/interaction defects."
