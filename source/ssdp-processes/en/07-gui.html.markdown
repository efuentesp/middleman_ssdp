This is the process of transforming the low-fidelity prototypes (Interface layouts) into the high-fidelity prototypes (HTML pages or forms), in adherence with the user interface standards and functional patterns authorized for its use in the application. The high-fidelity prototypes do not implement application functionality, and usually provide navigation capabilities among the GUI elements (menuâ€™s, pages/forms).
