front_description: "The process of integrating technical and implementation context considerations into the functional component specification. Technical considerations may include:

    Non-standard behavior for user interface elements, security/authorization, failure-mode and effects, transaction demarcation/distribution, etc.
    Mapping to physical/implementation components (physical database model, physical environment elements, etc)
    Detailed contracts for inter-system integration (i.e. rejection of interfaces, failure detection and recovery/alert protocols, etc.)"
