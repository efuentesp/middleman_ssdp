title: Traditional SSDP v3
description: "The Softtek's Software Development Process consists of 6 sequential phases distributed along time, each of them has a main milestone; each phase is essentially a time lapse that occurs between 2 main milestones. Each phase has an assessment in order to determine whether its objectives were met. A satisfactory assessment of each phase allows moving towards the next one. Each phase is made of a group of activities and products assigned to a group of specific roles. "
